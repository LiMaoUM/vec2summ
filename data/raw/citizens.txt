How many decades was the citizenship question on the Census? Please understand this is exactly WHY I have not and will NOT turn mine in. 
WE know why you want illegals counted. For more congressional seats.

Trumps effort to deport 800K undocumented immigrants brought here before 2007 as kids struck down as cruel;
Just like he lost adding a citizenship question to the census to discourage minorities from responding.

Pelosi wants the Illegal voters.
That's why she removed the CITIZENSHIP QUESTION from #2020Census Since 2014 CA DMV automatically registers illegals to vote+issued valid Dr Lic like ours.
That's how DNC stole the house in 2018.
